### Game instructions:
-------------------------

First you can chose your character, but you can only play with the bonus char, if you get the minimum aumount of treasure to buy and unlock them. 

The game is simple, you start in a random place inside the dungeon and you should go fast seek for the treasure, because the minotaus can run faster than you and it becomes hard to find it before they caught you!

Unless you get the treasure, you can escape the dungeon and win the game! Becareful, the minotaurs are so fast and hungry! Good luck xD!
